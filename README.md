# Hash Code Template

A basic file structure to jump start the project

## Compile

You can compile the source code either by manually running the GCC compiler from your terminal using `g++ src/*.cpp fmt/*.cc -Ic:/headers` or you could use GNU Make like and just run `make` from your terminal.

### Note:

If you're on Windows make might not be installed or it could have a different name.
If you installed the compiler through Mingw-w64 you can use make typing `mingw32-make`, or you can also install it from your terminal using `choco install make`
